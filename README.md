# col-To_Run_Codes_On_Termux  
```
- Launching colL sereis, with Chinese, English and Klingon version.
- Comming up col series, function vcd, vuv, etc.
- Check the content before running them, Zhubo quite unsure of its safety or bugs, AI suggests fine, Zhubo not confident.
```
- Generated with Qoder the AI IDE.
  - Zhubo knows a shxt about linux or shell script but Zhubo needs it to run codes on Zhubo's Android phone as it is really cool and Zhubo can code everywhere.
  - You this is Android logic ah.
- A script tool to encase calls for compilers and packages for easier use on the phone.
  - Unroot friendly, so hooray Moumi runners !
  - Zhubo knows it is impossible to remain concise on professional tools, but dude you are working on a phone, so an fully functional IDE is, well hard to achieve. So far, Zhubo envisions using `uv` or pip-venv and git to manage. The latest progress is shown on the board above.
  - Zhubo envision a function called `vcd`, virtual directory.
- How to run it
  - They might come in interface or not
  - Do launch them within the `~` directory of Termux, or else blokced by Android.
  - It comes in 3 sereis, with different names. Names work when you launch them as a script by what they are named.
    - by such as `./col13`, `./colL4`, `./colExRs3`, `./colWhateverRenamed`
  - Help infos are within, or you can like `./col13 --help` to check help infos without officially launching it.
  - Press ctrl+C to exit the interface.
- Bilungual originally supperted
  - Zhubo use AI to generate `Chinese` version and use AI to gnerate `English` version
  - Zhubo found a thing called Klingon, Zhubo happy.
- You might have heard the project “Termirun”, you might have not because it is a immature project with such cool name which it doesn't support. Now here comes the successer, the col sereis.

- The col series comes in 3 lineups:
  - **col** sereis: 
    - Interface & single call
    - In `.sh` script, ordinary, full function.
    - Extensions supporetd and to be added.
    - Zhubo might sutck in whatever he thinks of the next second after.
    - Has mechanism of **`vcd`**, along with **proot** environment, and capatable **extensions**, it can immitate the usage of some packages by intercepting their commands, and try to actually execute them elsewhere.


  - **colL** sereis: 
    - Interface
    - In `.sh` script, smaller and lighter.
    - Functions such as "vcd", "set", support for extensions are removed, 
    - Zhubo think this is good enough dude you are coding an a phone
  - **colEx** series:
    - Zhubo try use AI transfer to `Rust` and further `standalone biary` so is it concise (I hope)
    - Theoretically functions the same as the original `col` series.
    - The rest, unsure.
- This should be a long term projectm I hope? But Zhubo not planning to learn shell script. Zhubo needs to fucus now on learning c and numpy.
- Again this is never about to build a comprehendsive "IDE", it's about to build a handy one.
